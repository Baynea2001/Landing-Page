# Landing-Page
This webpage is one of my first projects in which I will get to utilize all the tools and styles I have learned so far. This includes github, git, CSS, HTML, flexbox, and a few others, in combination I hope these tools and my knowledge will make a visually pleasing and aesthetic webpage.
